# Feature Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the 4 requested features.

## 1. Track Downloaded Files with Blacklist Database ✅

**Implementation:**
- Created `blacklist.py` with SQLite database to track all processed files
- Tracks filename, reason, and timestamp for each blacklisted file
- Supports multiple blacklist reasons: `TOO_SMALL`, `DELETED`, `BORING_BACKGROUND`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Download only new wallpapers (skips blacklisted and already downloaded)
reddit --new 50

# The blacklist is automatically used to skip:
# - Files already downloaded
# - Files that were too small
# - Files you deleted
# - Files filtered as boring
```

**How It Works:**
1. When downloading, `filter_new_urls()` checks both filesystem and blacklist
2. Small images are automatically added to blacklist before deletion
3. User-deleted images (via `rice --delete`) are blacklisted
4. Boring background images are blacklisted
5. Each SFW/NSFW folder has its own `.blacklist.db` file

**Benefits:**
- Never re-download the same file twice
- Efficiently find new wallpapers from large Reddit posts
- Specify exactly how many new wallpapers you want with `--new`

## 2. Boring Background Detection ✅

**Implementation:**
- Created `imageanalysis.py` with `is_boring_background()` function
- Analyzes border pixels (top, bottom, left, right edges)
- Detects if >70% of border is white (>240 brightness) or black (<15 brightness)
- Configurable threshold via `BORING_BACKGROUND_THRESHOLD` in config.py

**Usage:**
```bash
# Filter boring backgrounds during download
reddit --filter-boring

# Adjust sensitivity in config.py
BORING_BACKGROUND_THRESHOLD = 0.7  # 70% of border must be white/black
```

**How It Works:**
1. Samples 10px border around the entire image
2. Calculates brightness for each pixel (RGB average)
3. Counts pixels that are very bright (white) or very dark (black)
4. If ratio exceeds threshold, marks as boring and blacklists

**Benefits:**
- Automatically filters out boring white/black background images
- Saves manual effort of deleting them later
- Configurable sensitivity

**Technical Details:**
The algorithm samples the border because:
- Modal color analysis is computationally expensive
- Border analysis is more reliable for detecting "boring" backgrounds
- Most boring backgrounds have consistent borders
- Fast enough to run on every downloaded image

## 3. Blacklist Current Wallpaper ✅

**Implementation:**
- Added `--delete` flag to `rice` command
- Reads current wallpaper from `~/.cache/wal/wal`
- Adds to blacklist with `DELETED` reason
- Removes file from disk

**Usage:**
```bash
# Apply random wallpaper
rice

# Don't like it? Delete and blacklist it
rice --delete

# Get another wallpaper
rice

# The deleted one will never be downloaded again
```

**How It Works:**
1. Reads current wallpaper path from pywal cache
2. Determines which folder (SFW/NSFW) it's from
3. Uses appropriate blacklist database
4. Adds filename with `DELETED` reason
5. Deletes the file
6. Future downloads skip this file

**Benefits:**
- Quick workflow to curate your collection
- Never see the same unwanted wallpaper again
- Separate tracking for why files were removed (too small vs deleted)

## 4. NSFW Channel Support ✅

**Implementation:**
- Updated `config.py` with separate SFW/NSFW folders
- Added `--nsfw` flag to both `reddit` and `rice` commands
- Each channel has its own blacklist database
- Folders: `~/Downloads/Wallpapers/sfw/` and `~/Downloads/Wallpapers/nsfw/`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Download SFW wallpapers (default)
reddit wallpaper -n 200

# Download NSFW wallpapers
reddit wallpapers_nsfw --nsfw -n 100

# Apply SFW wallpaper (default)
rice

# Apply NSFW wallpaper
rice --nsfw

# Delete from current channel
rice --delete  # Removes from last applied channel
```

**How It Works:**
1. `reddit --nsfw` downloads to `nsfw/` folder
2. `rice --nsfw` selects from `nsfw/` folder
3. Each folder has independent `.blacklist.db`
4. Wallpapers never mix between channels
5. Channel name is displayed in output

**Benefits:**
- Keep work-appropriate and personal wallpapers separate
- Easy switching with single flag
- Independent management (blacklists, downloads)
- Clear separation prevents accidents

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE blacklist (
    filename TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

### File Structure
```
~/Downloads/Wallpapers/
├── sfw/
│   ├── .blacklist.db
│   └── [wallpaper images]
└── nsfw/
    ├── .blacklist.db
    └── [wallpaper images]
```

### Key Functions Added

**blacklist.py:**
- `BlacklistDB.add(filename, reason)` - Add to blacklist
- `BlacklistDB.is_blacklisted(filename)` - Check if blacklisted
- `BlacklistDB.get_reason(filename)` - Get blacklist reason
- `BlacklistDB.list_all()` - List all blacklisted files

**imageanalysis.py:**
- `is_boring_background(image_path, threshold)` - Detect boring backgrounds
- `get_dominant_color(image_path)` - Get dominant colors (utility function)

**download.py:**
- `filter_new_urls(urls, folder, blacklist_db)` - Filter to only new URLs
- `download_images(..., max_new)` - Limit downloads to N new files

### Configuration Changes

**config.py additions:**
```python
WALLPAPER_BASE_FOLDER = Path.home() / "Downloads" / "Wallpapers"
WALLPAPER_FOLDER_SFW = WALLPAPER_BASE_FOLDER / "sfw"
WALLPAPER_FOLDER_NSFW = WALLPAPER_BASE_FOLDER / "nsfw"
BORING_BACKGROUND_THRESHOLD = 0.7
```

## Workflow Examples

### Curating Your Collection
```bash
# Download 300 wallpapers, filtering boring ones
reddit wallpaper --filter-boring -n 300

# Browse through them
rice
rice
rice

# Delete ones you don't like
rice --delete
rice  # Get next one
rice --delete
rice

# Download 50 more NEW wallpapers (skips all previous)
reddit --new 50
```

### NSFW Management
```bash
# Set up both channels
reddit wallpaper -n 200          # SFW
reddit wallpapers_nsfw --nsfw -n 100  # NSFW

# Use SFW during work
rice

# Use NSFW at home
rice --nsfw

# Each maintains its own blacklist
rice --delete        # Removes from SFW
rice --nsfw --delete # Removes from NSFW
```

### Efficient Downloading
```bash
# Fetch 500 posts but only download 100 new unique ones
reddit wallpaper -n 500 --new 100

# This is smart:
# - Fetches 500 Reddit posts
# - Filters out already downloaded
# - Filters out blacklisted
# - Downloads first 100 new unique images
# - Filters small images
# - Filters boring backgrounds (if --filter-boring)
```

## Testing Performed

All features have been validated:

✅ Blacklist database creation and queries
✅ Boring background detection (white, black, colorful)
✅ CLI help messages for new flags
✅ Python syntax compilation
✅ Module imports
✅ Integration with existing code

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible:
- Default behavior unchanged (uses SFW folder)
- New flags are optional
- Existing wallpapers can be migrated to sfw/ folder
- No breaking changes to existing workflows

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

Potential future improvements:
- Web UI to browse blacklist
- Export/import blacklist
- Undo blacklist entry
- Statistics on blacklist reasons
- Machine learning for better boring detection
